Refer to the root level README for installation instructions.

## Creating a new component

To create a new component, run the following command:

```
npm run generate:component
```

This will prompt you for the name of the component you want to create. The component will be created in the `src/` directory with a component class file and a stylesheet. It will also be added to the exports in the `package.json`.
