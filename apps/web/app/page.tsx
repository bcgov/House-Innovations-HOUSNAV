            The British Columbia Ministry of Housing is presenting this proof of
            concept (POC) as an initial test of a guided walk-through for two

            You may choose from the below two cards to be taken through each
            section one at a time. You will be presented with questions about
            your proposed building structure to determine the applicable code
            requirements. At the conclusion of the walk-through you will be
            presented with the option to review and download the questions along
            with your answers and the corresponding building code requirements.
